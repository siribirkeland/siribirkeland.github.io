Hi, my name is Siri and I am a plant evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in Oslo. In my research, I aim to better understand the molecular basis of the processes generating plant diversity, like speciation and adaptation. I recently started a new group - this is our page!

## Lab news
- **October 31**: New paper in *Trends of Plant Science* "An updated perspective: what genes make a tree a tree?" [Link](https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(25)00282-1?rss=yes)
- **October 29**: In memory of Richard Abbott: "Phylogeography of Arctic plants: where are we after 35&nbsp;years, and where to go?" [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17550874.2025.2571098#abstract)
- **October 14**: Congratulations to our new postdoc, Cassandra Elphinstone, for winning the audience prize for her presentation during the MSc, PhD, and postdoc days at the Natural History Museum!
- **October 6**: We are thrilled to welcome Cassandra Elphinstone, who is joining us during her NSERC postdoctoral fellowship! We look forward to working with you, Cassandra!
- **September 25**: This week we were very lucky to host Levi Yant! He gave a fascinating talk in our Tangled Bank seminar series entitled ‚ÄúA Polyploid Paradox: Might Polyploid Diversity Arise from Maladapted DNA Replication and Repair?‚Äù Thank you, Levi!
- **September 15**: We are very pleased to welcome Fenna Sondorp to the lab. Fenna is an intern from the Inholland University of Applied Sciences and will stay with us until May.
- **July 29**: Super happy to finally see our opinion piece on pathway convergence out in *Trends in Genetics* [Link](https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(25)00160-X). Written together with colleague and friend, Peter Hoitinga. 
- **July 1**: We are excited to announce an opening for a PhD Research Fellow in Plant Evolutionary Genomics. The position offers the opportunity to explore evolutionary processes in Arctic plants using experimental and population genomic approaches.

- **June 30**: Excited to share two new preprints: "1000 conifer genomes: Genome innovation, organisation and diversity" [Link](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6502828/v1) üå≤ and "Comparative regulomics provides novel insight into the evolution of wood formation across dicot and conifer trees" [Link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.28.661522v1.abstract) üå≥
- **June 5**: We were pleased to welcome Dr. Elizabeth Stunz from the University of Gothenburg for a visit to the lab. She delivered an excellent Tangled Bank Seminar titled "Landscape resistance and gene flow dynamics of widespread Arctic sedge and shrub species in Alaska, USA." 
- **Februrary 25**: New paper! "Moisture-responsive root-branching pathways identified in diverse maize breeding germplasm" is now published in Science! This is the result of a fun collaboration with the Dinneny lab at Stanford University. A big congrats to Jos√© Dinneny and lead author Johannes Scharwies! [Link](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads5999) 
- **February 25**: Visit from Assistant Professor Barnabas Daru, Stanford University. @Barnabas: Thank you so much for giving a very interesting workshop on "The Hidden Potential of Herbarium Specimens for Biogeography and Ecology" for us at the Natural History Museum in Oslo!
- **February 25**: We have two visitors to the group this spring: PhD student Tereza Koberov√° from the Kol√°≈ô group in Prague, Czechia and postdoc Lucia Moreyra from the Susanna group at Institut Bot√†nic de Barcelona, Spain - Welcome!
- **August 24**: Siri gave a presentation about the evolution of cacti to the Norwegian Botanical Association. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXdS9glAlew)
