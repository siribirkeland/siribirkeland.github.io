Hi, my name is Siri and I am a plant evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in Oslo. In my research, I aim to better understand the molecular basis of the processes generating plant diversity, like speciation and adaptation. I recently started a new group - this is our page!

## Lab news
- **Februrary 25**: New paper! "Moisture-responsive root-branching pathways identified in diverse maize breeding germplasm" is now published in Science! This is the result of a fun collaboration with the Dinneny lab at Stanford University. A big congrats to José Dinneny and lead author Johannes Scharwies!

- **February 25**: Visit from Assistant Professor Barnabas Daru from Stanford University. @Barnabas: Thank you so much for giving a very interesting workshop on "The Hidden Potential of Herbarium Specimens for Biogeography and Ecology" for us at the Natural History Museum in Oslo!
- **February 25**: We have two visitors to the group this spring: PhD student Tereza Koberová from the Kolář group in Prague, Czechia and postdoc Lucia Moreyra from the Susanna group at Institut Botànic de Barcelona, Spain - Welcome!
- **August 24**: Siri gave a presentation about the evolution of cacti to the Norwegian Botanical Association.
- **July 24**: New publication in collaboration with the Yant lab "Impact of whole-genome duplications on structural variant evolution in Cochlearia" out in Nature Communications [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49679-y) Tremendous effort by Tuomas Hämälä!
- **July 24**: PhD student Lise Huseby had her first conference presentation at the XX International Botanical Congress this summer - Congratulations Lise!
