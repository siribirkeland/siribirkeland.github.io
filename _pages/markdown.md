# Our values

In our lab, we like to share our enthusiasm for northern plant biology and evolution in a way that inspires curiosity and engagement. Through our collective efforts, we strive to make a positive impact on both the scientific community and society as a whole. 

We aim to cultivate a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, where everyone feels encouraged to explore new ideas and contribute to meaningful research endeavors. We believe in the strength that comes from embracing a variety of perspectives and personalities. We recognize that the strongest research endeavors emerge from the fusion of diverse personalities and skill sets, where each individual's strengths are celebrated and leveraged. Our commitment to diversity extends beyond mere acknowledgment; it is fundamental to who we are and how we operate. 

We deeply consider our role as scientists both within society and the scientific community. We believe in the transformative power of research not only to advance knowledge but also to ignite a passion for biology within our local community. Our long-term goal is to pursue projects that bridge the gap between academia and society, fostering immediate interest in biology while nurturing a diverse and inclusive scientific community.
