In our lab, we deeply consider our role as scientists within both society and the scientific community. We believe in the transformative power of research - not only to advance knowledge, but to ignite a passion for biology within our local community. Our long-term goal is to pursue projects that bridge the gap between academia and society, fostering curiosity about biology while nurturing a diverse and inclusive scientific community.  

We aim to cultivate a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, where everyone feels encouraged to explore new ideas and contribute to meaningful research. We believe in the strength that comes from embracing a variety of perspectives, backgrounds, and personalities. The strongest research emerges from the fusion of diverse skill sets, where each individualâ€™s strengths are recognized, celebrated, and leveraged.  

These values reflect not only who we are, but who we aspire to be in academia. We recognize that they may sound idealistic, but we believe it's important to articulate the kind of scientific community we want to create - so that we can actively work toward it.
