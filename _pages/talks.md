## Current lab members

### Lise Grønnerød Huseby, PhD student
![Lise Huseby](/images/Lise_resized4.jpeg) <br />
Lise is interested in the genetic basis of plant speciation and aims to test the snowball theory for the rate of evolution of hybrid incompatibilities in *Arabidopsis lyrata*. <br />

<br />
### Marie Kristine Brandrud, Guest Researcher
![Marie Kristine Brandrud](/images/Marie_resize3.jpeg) <br />
Marie is interested in genomics and speciation. The Brochmann-group at the Natural History Museum has previously showed an accumulation of redproductive incompatibilities in arctic selfing species, and Marie is currently working to genetically pinpoint those incompatibilities with QTL analysis in Cochlearia groenlandica. She also aims to investigate chromosome evolution in Cochlearia and will compare the Cochlearia groenlandica genome to its sister, Cochlearia excelsa, in a collaborative project with the Yant Lab at Nottingham University. <br />

We welcome inquiries from motivated individuals who share our passion for plants and evolution! Whether you're a postdoctoral researcher seeking new challenges, a recent MSc looking to pursue a Ph.D., or a bachelor student seeking a potential master project, drop me an email at siri.birkeland@nhm.uio.no! 
<br />
Note that we will soon be announcing a PhD position within Arctic plant genomics! We are also happy to support individual postdoc and researcher applications like the [MSCA postdoctoral fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), or the [Human Frontier Science Program Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships). The Natural History Museum also has their own postdoctoral fellowship within the [STADIS research hub](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/stadis/) which is announced at a yearly basis.

## The EDGE group
Our lab is a part of the [EDGE group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/edge/) at the Natural History Museum in Oslo. EDGE is an interdisciplinary research group consisting of people working on areas ranging from plant speciation and phylogenomics, the development of metabarcoding as a next-generation biodiversity assessment tool for society, and people's influence on wild plants through use and trade throughout history.
