## The EDGE group
Our lab is a part of the [EDGE group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/edge/) at the Natural History Museum in Oslo. EDGE is an interdisciplinary research group consisting of people working on areas ranging from plant speciation and phylogenomics, the development of metabarcoding as a next-generation biodiversity assessment tool for society, and people's influence on wild plants through use and trade throughout history.
