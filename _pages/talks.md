Lise is interested in the genetic basis of plant speciation and aims to test the snowball theory for the rate of evolution of hybrid incompatibilities in *Arabidopsis lyrata*. <br />

### Marie Kristine Brandrud, Guest Researcher

## The EDGE group
Our lab is a part of the [EDGE group](https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/edge/) at the Natural History Museum in Oslo. The EDGE group is composed of an interdisciplinary group of researchers interested in areas ranging from plant speciation and phylogenomics, the development of metabarcoding as a next-generation biodiversity assessment tool for society, and people's influence on wild plants through use and trade throughout history.
